Zeno Lend is a decentralized lending platform focused on capital efficiency allowing individuals and protocols to supply and borrow cryptocurrencies on the platform. It is helping build a better and safer DeFi lending ecosystem, by driving capital efficiency with trusted entities as the liquidity infrastructure and backbone for DeFi and CeFi.

The platform's primary focus is on providing capital to individuals. However, the team plans to expand their offerings in the future to include protocol-to-protocol lending.
